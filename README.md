### A project to learn and practice closure
#### Project idea: The Odin Project

A modern version of the ancient Tic-tac-toe; where you as a knight, are pitched against the Robots' bloodthirsty invasion:

- Players can choose their turns and weapons
- Rematch and Revenge
- Test your valor in a fight with Impossible A.I.
